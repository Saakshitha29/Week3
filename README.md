In this week I've deployed the model using the interface builder gradio there it will detect the device based on the image and will display the confidence rate . And by this project we can classify the e_waste easily .
Here we used an transfer learning technique and used the EffcientNetV2B0 base model it is an lightweight model.It works fast.
